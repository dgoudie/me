	<Hobby name="Running">
		Running is great. I've been running/training for the last 4-5 years as a fun past-time that I
		can enjoy with other friends who run. At the time of writing this, I've raced 4 marathons, and
		have ran a couple ultramarathons. My goal over the next 5 years or so is to run all of the major
		marathons. My fastest marathon time as of writing this is 2h 43m 25s at the Marine Corps
		Marathon in DC.

	<Hobby name="Old School Runescape">
		Old School Runescape (OSRS) is my favorite game of all time, one I've been playing for nearly 20
		years. I've got a big community of friends from around the world that I play the game with. I
		recently earned the rank of Grandmaster on my 'Ironman' OSRS account.
	</Hobby>
	<Hobby name="&quot;Working&quot;">
		I am lucky to consider what I do for a living as one of my hobbies. Outside of my job, I enjoy
		building websites and applications for fun. A couple of my recent home projects include app that
		I use at the gym called <a href="https://isometric.goudie.dev" target="_blank">ISOMETRIC</a> and
		an app called <a href="https://fauxbingo.com">FauxBingo</a> that's used by my OSRS community a few
		times a year to run a 'Bingo'-style game.
